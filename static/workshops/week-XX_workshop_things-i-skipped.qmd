# Week 1: Intro to RMarkdown

-----------

## Things I intended to cover

This is a list of things I intended to cover but did not have enough time.

- Add some code chunks to the document

- Add some text to the document

- Add some inline code chunks to the document 

- Add a very basic chart and a table ({gt}) ()

- Add an image

- Some things to know now:

  - Code chunk names
  
  - It's sometimes easier to create a pixel perfect ggplot2 as an image and inset that into the document
  
  - Table solutions for different output formats

- Switch to the assessment project

  - Explain what's different in there
