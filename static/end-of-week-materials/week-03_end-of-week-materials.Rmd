Due to the Queen's funeral, the material for "week 3" was delivered on Monday 10th October. This material was also delivered via MS Teams as the lecturer had COVID-19.

In this week we talked more about using the tidyverse for doing basic data science.

As always you can find the materials I wrote during the course in this folder:
