Due to the Queen's funeral, the material for "week 1" was delivered on Monday 26th September.

In this week's materials we made our first RMarkdown document.

As always you can find the materials I wrote during the course in this folder:

[https://github.com/charliejhadley/eng7218_data-science-for-healthcare-applications_bcu-masters/tree/main/static/end-of-week-materials/bcu-week-01](https://github.com/charliejhadley/eng7218_data-science-for-healthcare-applications_bcu-masters/tree/main/static/end-of-week-materials/bcu-week-01)

The folder also contains the Etherpad notes from the session.
