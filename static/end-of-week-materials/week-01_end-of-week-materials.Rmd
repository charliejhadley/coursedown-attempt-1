In this week's materials we made our first RMarkdown document.

As always you can find the materials I wrote during the course in this folder:

[https://github.com/charliejhadley/eng7218_data-science-for-healthcare-applications_bcu-masters/tree/main/static/end-of-week-materials/bcu-week-1](https://github.com/charliejhadley/eng7218_data-science-for-healthcare-applications_bcu-masters/tree/main/static/end-of-week-materials/bcu-week-1)

The folder also contains the Etherpad notes from the session.
