# p-value notes

I'm dumping a bunch of useful stuff about p-values I found while writing Week 02 now.

## Twitter poll: same p-values different sizes

"If you have two studies with the *exact* same p-value, one with a small sample size and one with a large sample size, which would you find more convincing?"

And a GREAT follow-up article from the author https://livefreeordichotomize.com/2018/08/21/p-value-thoughts-a-twitter-follow-up/

Lucy Dâ€™Agostino McGowan follows up in 2022 with a great talk "What is the value of the p-value" (https://www.lucymcgowan.com/talk/north_carolina_translational_and_clinical_sciences_institute/) and the slides can be found here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1W51xBJOG7C37vHLJuBR4WT6NCJXQN0Iah-NKk9VCLxg/edit#slide=id.p

Good tweet about what a p-value shows
