# Getting to know me

---

# Charlotte Hadley

Please call me Charlotte or Charlie. My pronouns are she/her.

--

I don't have a doctorate so it's inaccurate to call me "Dr Hadley" or "Professor Hadley".

--

If you absolutely must call be by a title your only option is "Miss Hadley".

---

# What do I do?

I'm currently a full-time independent data science consultant and trainer through [Visible Data Ltd](https://www.visibledata.co.uk/about.html).

--

## Academic background

- 2015-2019: I worked at University of Oxford as a Research Support Officer and built the [Interactive Data Network](https://idn.it.ox.ac.uk/).

- 2010-2012: I began but ultimately quit a PhD in biomineralisation.

- 2006-2010: MPhys and BSc in physics from University of Leeds with a focus on biophysics

--

## Industry background

- 2016-2022: I've been consulting and delivering training in industry both in-person and via LinkedIn Learning..

- 2012-2015: I was a senior consultant at Wolfram Research

# Getting to know you

---

# Can you tell me a little bit about yourselves?

- Your name

- Your pronouns

- Where you're from

- What have you studied before this Masters?

???

The first in take has only 6 students, so this works for now but might not be scalable.

---

# Introducing Etherpad

We're going to use "Etherpads" during lectures and workshops so I can ask you questions and share code.

Here's the link for today's pad: [bit.ly/eng7218_week-1_lecture-slides](https://bit.ly/eng7218_week-1_lecture-slides)

# How does this course work?

---

# Course Structure

We have 11 weeks of teaching and each week has:

- an 2 hour lecture

  - In the lectures I will introduce topics and theory
  
  - Two hours is too long for most people to pay 100% attention.<br>
  I'll insert breaks and experiment with other ways to break up the lecures.


- an 2 hour workshop

  - These workshops are **crucial** for you to do well in the workshops.
  
  - The workshops will mix together guided and exploratory work.

---

# Laptops

This is a practical data science course - please think of the whole course as a lab.

Please **bring your laptop to every lecture and workshop**.

If this isn't practical for you **please** speak to me<sup>1</sup> and I will find a solution.

<hr>

In today's workshop I will take you through all of the steps necessary to setup your machine to use R.

.footnote[
[1] See next slide!
]

---

# Asking questions

> If you have a question during the lectures or workshops **please ask the question** when they come tlo mind.
>
> There's no such thing as a 'pointless question' - particularly as in this course you'll be learning data science and using **four** different programming languages.

--

If you want to ask me questions outside of our sessions please email me **charlotte.hadley@bcu.ac.uk**.

---

# Course materials and websites

I'd like to ask you **not** to read ahead in the lecture slides or workshops. This is because there are some exercises I'd like you to try in week `N` that are solved for you in week `N + 1`.

As with all BCU modules you can find the lecture notes on Moodle.

However! 

This course has a dedicated website ([eng7218.netlify.app](https://eng7218.netlify.app/)) that contains more materials than the Moodle page.

---

# Course assessment

This module is 100% assessed with coursework that must be submitted **before 12:00 on Friday, 13 January 2023**.

Part of the coursework will require you to learn to use R and RMarkdown.

> I want to talk about the *goals* of this course before giving more details about how the assessment will work.

# How to succeed in this course:

I want to break down each of these in turn:

- Feel confident in lectures

- Feel confident in workshops

- Feel confident in designing (and reading) data visualisations

- Feel confident in the assessment

---

## Feel confident in lectures

For you to feel confident in the lectures I want you to:

- Ask questions if you feel lost or don't understand something.

- Understand **why** something is being taught in the context of the module goals.
  
---

## Module goals
  
- <span style='opacity:1'>Demonstrate a systematic understanding of the principles and approaches in data science to be used in healthcare.</span>

- <span style='opacity:0.1'>Critically appraise the key considerations for using healthcare data including ethics, information governance and security issues relevant to health data science.</span>

- <span style='opacity:0.1'>Apply knowledge of the R language to read and wrangle healthcare datasets into the R environment for analysis.</span>

- <span style='opacity:0.1'>Design data visualisations and tables with the R language to communicate properties of datasets and the conclusions of data analysis.</span>

## Feel confident in workshops

The workshops will run a little differently to the lectures.

As we progress through the weeks we'll move away from you completing very specific tasks to more open eneded goals.

<br>

- Ask questions if you feel lost or don't understand something.

- Become confident in figuring out why your code doesn't work and problem solving it.

- Become confident in exploring new ideas, particularly different ways to explore and visualise data.

---

## Feel confident in reading and designing data visualisations

Week 4 is meant to be when we focus on data visualisation.

However, we will start using data visualisations right from the beginning of the course.

# Feeling confident in the assessment

## How the assessment is designed

There are two very different components to the assessment:

- the written component which requires you to explain concepts and critically analyse case studies.

  - You will use Microsoft Word (or your word processor of choice) for this part of the assessment.

- the coding component which requires you to write code to read, wrangle and visualise survey data.

  - You will use R and RMarkdown for this part of the assessment.

---

## How the assessment is designed

There are 3 different sections in the assessment:

| Section | Type of assessment |
| :-- | :-- |
| Part A) Open health data and anonymisation  | Written component |
| Part B) Algorithms and health data | Written component |
| Part C) Analyse and visualize results from a health data survey | Coding component |

The [module website provides more details about these sections](https://eng7218.netlify.app/assessment/).

The [colour coded timetable](https://eng7218.netlify.app/timetable/) demonstrates which lectures and workshops will help you with each section.

---

## Written component of the assessment

You will need to use *case studies* to demonstrate your understanding of concepts introduced in the lectures.

The course websites' [case studies section](https://eng7218.netlify.app/resources/case-studies/) includes all the case studies we will cover in the course. 

You are also strongly encouraged to research your own case studies.

---

## Coding component of the assessment

You will be making use of a tool called RMarkdown to answer the last part of the courswork

> Part C) Analyse and visualize results from a health data survey

RMarkdown allows you to write reports, presentations and even entire websites<sup>1</sup> It's a very powerful tool that is widely used in industry and academia.

The thing that's powerful about it is that you can include (and run) R code in your documents.

.footnote[
[1] These slides and the entire module website is written with RMarkdown documents.
]

---

## Coding component of the assessment

In the very first workshop I will thoroughly introduce you to R and RMarkdown.

In every subsequent workshop we will use RMarkdown.

You should have sufficient practice and expertise to answer the coding component of the coursework.

I will check in with you all about your confidence with the assessment in Week 8.

# New slide

We'll actually put some content here.

This slide template has been modified such that I can fit a LOT more content than the defaults for {xaringan}. Which could be dangerous.

Let's add some code

```{r, eval=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
ggplot() +
  theme_gray()
```
